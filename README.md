Our group project has the following goals:

1. Analyze the Telco Customer Churn [dataset]([url](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yeanzc/telco-customer-churn-ibm-dataset)) from kaggle
2. Answer the question: How can we predict if a person is about to churn (to unsubscribe)?
3. In the interest of creating a unique project, we will adapt the dataset with pandas to focus on data that students during our in class presentation could answer on the spot.
4. With this adapted dataset, we'll explore machine learning techniques with scikitlearn to find the best possible predictive model.
5. Through an interactive dashboard, we'll ask students in class a series of questions, and use our model to predict their own likelyhood of churning.

This read-me will be updated at the end of our project to reflect our progress. Group members will individually push their contributions with detailed comments throughout the process.
